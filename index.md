# Hello I'm Jordi!

I'm a Software Engineer with more than 10 years experience. I work mainly with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, but I've also used Python in the past. I've worked in London, San Francisco and New York, for companies of different sizes, from as little as 3 people to 1000s of people. Now I work remotely from Barcelona, preferably looking for contract work, but I'm open to discuss permanent positions if they sound interesting.

I can help you get your project through the finish line. I like simplicity and solving complex problems. I can also provide feedback around roadmap, product management and project management. Most recently I helped launch in under 6 months [Roomsie](https://roomsie.com), a rental marketplace that had failed to launch for more than two years.

Back in the day I worked for [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs) in San Francisco, where I worked on different client projects and I also was part of the team that delivered the first version of the [Cloud Foundry Ops Manager](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-components/pcf-ops-manager). 

Below you can find a list of some of the skills and technologies I'm familiar with:

* Ruby and Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* PostgreSQL
* API design
* Payments integration (including split charges and payouts, escrow, refunds, partial-refunds, ...)
* Marketplaces
* Transactional Emails
* Automated Testing (unit, integration and browser tests)
* Continuous Integration (most recently CircleCI but I've also used Jenkins)
* Screen Scraping
* Integrating with third party APIs (Google Maps, Twilio, S3, ...)
* Version Control: Git
