<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>

<div class="item-header">
    <h3>Software Engineer at <a href="https://saas.group">saas.group</a>, Remote</h3>
    <h3>Jan 2023 – Present</h3>
</div>

<p>
    During my tenure at <a href="https://saas.group">saas.group</a>, a portfolio company specializing in
    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), I was exclusively assigned to the <a href="https://rewardful.com">Rewardful</a> team.
    Rewardful is renowned for its effortless affiliate program management for SaaS companies using Stripe or Paddle.
</p>

<p>
    My contributions were instrumental in scaling and enhancing Rewardful's software capabilities during
    a critical phase when the platform was grappling with inefficient queries and memory issues. Here are
    some of my notable contributions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Advocated for and implemented a PostgreSQL upgrade from version
        12 to 13, resulting in a 10x performance improvement in key queries and a 40% reduction in index
        size on heavily queried tables.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Code Efficiency</strong>: Rectified inefficient code that was consuming excessive memory, leading to an
        80% reduction in mean response time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Payment Integration</strong>: Transitioned a deprecated Stripe Elements integration to use Checkout
        Session for accepting promo codes on Rewardful's checkout page. Also transitioned from Payment
        Sources to Payment Methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Security Enhancement</strong>: Addressed a significant traffic surge due to an attack on Rewardful's site
        by integrating with Cloudflare, effectively mitigating the attack within a day.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer Integration</strong>: Simplified the integration process for customers using Stripe Payment
        Links by modifying the Rewardful JS script, eliminating the need for additional JS on the customer
        side.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Code Refactoring</strong>: Undertook a significant refactor of a key class, resolving three long-standing
        issues and enhancing overall system performance
    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>Technologies</strong>: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Sideqik, Heroku, Stripe, Cloudflare, StimulusJS, Hotwire Turbo

    <h3>Software Engineer at <a href="https://foxsoft.co.uk">Foxsoft</a>, Remote</h3>
    <h3>Mar 2022 – Oct 2022</h3>
</div>

<p>
    At <a href="https://foxsoft.co.uk">Foxsoft</a>, a company specializing in the rescue and rehabilitation
    of applications that have "gone off the rails" (applications abandoned by their original engineers and left in
    a state of disrepair), I played a crucial role in the successful recovery of two client projects.
</p>

<p>
    My responsibilities encompassed a wide range of tasks aimed at restoring the functionality and efficiency of these applications. These included:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Test Backfilling</strong>: Ensured the reliability and robustness of the applications by backfilling tests.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>CI/CD Pipeline Setup</strong>: Established a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitLab to streamline development and deployment processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Software Upgrades</strong>: Upgraded Rails from unsupported versions to enhance security and performance. Also upgraded Postgres to improve database efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Platform Upgrades</strong>: Upgraded the Heroku Stack and AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platform to leverage the latest features and improvements.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Following the successful rescue of these projects, I collaborated with clients to implement new features, further enhancing the value and utility of the applications.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Technologies</strong>: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk Stripe, Gitlab, jQuery, Docker.
